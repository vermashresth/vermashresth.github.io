I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard University advised by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe) with research interests in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Code Generation and Robust Fine-Tuning of LLMs. My work is motivated by the theme of using LLMs for complex decision-making tasks that require them to

  <li>generate and optimise code for problems specified in natural language by non-domain experts <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/074f42212be2c8ee651db00f17965ec4-Abstract-Conference.html"> [Decision LM] </a></li>
  <li>perform self-reflection, evolutionary search, and reasoning to produce high-quality code in real time <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35375"> [Priority2Reward] </a> </li>
  <li>provide safety guarantees when handling complex, multi-objective priorities <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/46651"> [Portfolios </a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112"> Social Choice LM] </a></li>
  <li>exhibit distributional robustness to noisy preferences during fine-tuning on offline data <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02709"> [Preference-Robust DPO] </a></li>
  <li>collaborate effectively with humans through multi-turn dialogues to reach efficient and reliable resolutions</li>
</ol>

Through this research, I aim to develop decision agents that democratise access to advanced analytical and optimisation tools, empowering non-experts to address AI for Social Impact challenges more effectively

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at [Google Research India](https://research.google/locations/india/), working in the [AI for Social Good lab](https://blog.google/technology/ai/30-new-ai-for-social-good-projects/) where I was grateful to be advised by [Dr. Aparna Taneja](https://research.google/people/aparna-taneja/). I developed and deployed robust bandit algorithms to plan targeted mobile health interventions for more than 100K beneficiaries from underserved communities in India.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at [United Health Group](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/people-and-businesses/businesses/optum.html) where I worked in the Chief Medical Officer's team for modelling readmission risks for millions of beneficiaries. I also worked with data from the world’s [largest healthcare graph database](https://info.tigergraph.com/keynote-edward-sverdlin), designing graph-based analytics and tools to model and interpret patients’ longitudinal wellness journeys.
