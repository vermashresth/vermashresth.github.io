I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard University advised by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe) with research interests in **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Code Generation** and **Robust Fine-Tuning of LLMs**. My work is motivated by the theme of using **LLMs for complex decision-making tasks** that require them to
1. generate and optimise code for problems specified in natural language by non-domain experts [Decision LM](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/074f42212be2c8ee651db00f17965ec4-Abstract-Conference.html)
2. perform self-reflection, evolutionary search, and reasoning to produce high-quality code in real time [Priority2Reward](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35375)
3. provide safety guarantees when handling complex, multi-objective priorities [Portfolios](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/46651), [Social Choice LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112)
4. exhibit distributional robustness to noisy preferences during fine-tuning on offline data [Preference-Robust DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02709)
5. collaborate effectively with humans through multi-turn dialogues to reach efficient and reliable resolutions

Through this research, I aim to develop decision agents that democratise access to advanced analytical and optimisation tools, empowering non-experts to address AI for Social Impact challenges more effectively

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at [Google Research India](https://research.google/locations/india/), working in the [AI for Social Good lab](https://blog.google/technology/ai/30-new-ai-for-social-good-projects/) where I was grateful to be advised by [Dr. Aparna Taneja](https://research.google/people/aparna-taneja/). I developed and deployed robust bandit algorithms to plan targeted mobile health interventions for more than 100K beneficiaries from underserved communities in India.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at [United Health Group](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/people-and-businesses/businesses/optum.html) where I worked in the Chief Medical Officer's team for modelling readmission risks for millions of beneficiaries. I also worked with data from the world’s [largest healthcare graph database](https://info.tigergraph.com/keynote-edward-sverdlin), designing graph-based analytics and tools to model and interpret patients’ longitudinal wellness journeys.
